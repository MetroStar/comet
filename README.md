# WarpSpeed USWDS Component Library

This component library was built in React with Typescript, based on the United States Web Design System (USWDS) 3.0 Design System. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simplified react version of USWDS.

## Getting Started

- `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
- `npm run storybook` to load up the Design System.

## Other Useful Commands

- `npm run test` to run Jest tests and code coverage.
- `npm run lint` to run ESLint on the Typescript code.
- `npm run prettier` to enforce code style with Prettier.

## Contributing

To publish a new version, first update the `version` tag in package.json, then run an `npm run rollup` to compile the release. Finally, run `npm publish` to make your updates available from npm install.
