# WarpSpeed

WarpSpeed is a React Web App accelerator for government agencies, who utilize USWDS.

In the beginning, WarpSpeed was built as a React/TypeScript component library for USWDS. Today however, it has become more of a framework for React Apps which require USWDS, as well as other functionality (charts, custom components, etc). And in the end, we hope to provide a set of tools, which can be all used together, or each as needed.

## Overview

`warpspeed` - The base USWDS component library implemented in React with TypeScript.

`warpspeed-data-viz` - A set of Victory Chart components provided as a WarpSpeed wrapper.

`warpspeed-extras` - A set of custom components, intended to fill in the gaps where USWDS does not provide an implementation.
